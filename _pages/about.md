Short Biography
======
I'm Zhehong Wang(王喆宏), a first-year master's student at [School of Computer Science](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/), [Nanjing University(NJU)](https://www.nju.edu.cn/), majoring in computer technology.

My primary research interests are edge computing and edge intelligence.

Education & Work Experience
======
I received my B.Sc. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology in Nanjing University in 2024.
After graduation, I was recommended for admission without entrance exams to Nanjing University's School of Computer Science and Technology (the former Department of Computer Science and Technology) to pursue a master's degree.

* Sept.2024 - current:   M.S. in computer technology, School of Computer Science
* Sept.2020 - June.2024: B.S. in computer science and technology, Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University

During my undergraduate years, I interned at [Qihoo 360](https://www.360.cn/) Technology Co Ltd.

* Dec.2023 - Apr.2024: security software engineer, at Digital Security Group, Qihoo 360 Technology Co Ltd, Nanjing


Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
